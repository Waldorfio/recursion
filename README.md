# Recursion Practice
Practicing recursion through the creation of a Fibonacci algorithm, and the infamous "merge-sort" algorithm in JavaScript.

### Goal
- To practice working explicitly with recursion.
- To practice creation of the mergesort algorithm through pseudocode.

### Challenges Faced
- Visualising the call stack and understanding which operations are currently being processed.
- Understanding how the merge algorithm follows from the recursion (and establishment of each base case).
- Concatenating leftover elements to avoid.
